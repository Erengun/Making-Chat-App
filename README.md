# Making-Chat-App
Steps for running the sample Chat application:

1. Open a terminal and Run the server-chat.py

2. Open a new terminal and run client-chat.py

            a) Enter the username with a ‘#’ prefix. Example: #alice

            b) Now, send the message to a user by following the format @username:message. Example: @bob:Hello, Bob! This is alice

3. Repeat step 2 for other users. (Maximum 5 users is allowed with server configuration i.e. server_socket.listen(5)

Limitations:

This demo on Python Chat Application has limited capabilities like the user get the message only after both parties enter the message to each other. Proper user validation etc. is not done.

To Do:

Test a simple cryptography feature.
Add proper Authentication of the user.

Note: both scripts are based on various Internet sources.
